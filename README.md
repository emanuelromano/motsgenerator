### Hello guys!

So, this is basically a React app to generate and download images with the alien languages from Coldplay's 'Music of the Spheres'. I made this as a hobby, just for fun. I liked it a lot so I decided to publish it here. I have in mind some changes and inprovements to this code, I'll try to apply them as soon as I can. Stay tuned!

## Changelog:
```
1.0 - Initial release
- Generate images with custom text in several alien fonts
- Change the gradient color on the background
- Set planets from The Spheres as the background with their respective language
- Random colors and fonts
- Play and pause background music
- English and Spanish UI
```

## Future features:
```
- Square (1:1), landscape (16:9) and portrait (9:16) aspect ratios
- Inprove website responsiveness on smaller screens
- New background music!
```

## Built with:
